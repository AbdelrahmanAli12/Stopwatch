# Stopwatch Project
This repository contains a stopwatch project implemented in the C programming language using Timer1 in compare mode and displaying the result on a 7-segment display using multiplexing technique. The project has been simulated on Proteus.

## Features
Stopwatch functionality: The project implements a stopwatch that can start, stop, and reset.
### Timer1 in compare mode: 
The Timer1 peripheral of the microcontroller is utilized in compare mode to measure the elapsed time.
### 7-segment display: 
The result of the stopwatch is displayed on a 7-segment display using multiplexing technique.
### Simulation on Proteus: 
The entire system has been simulated on Proteus, allowing for testing and verification.
## Files
#### main.c: Contains the main code for the stopwatch project as it is a small project.
#### README.md: Documentation file describing the project.
## Simulation
To simulate the project on Proteus, follow these steps:
Open Proteus simulation file.
you will fing the required components, including the microcontroller avr atmega 32, 7-segment display, and necessary connections.
Import the provided code files into the project.
Build and compile the project.
Run the simulation.
## Usage
Connect the microcontroller to the 7-segment display and necessary input buttons.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
The stopwatch will start automatically upon power-up.
Press the "Start/Stop" button to toggle between starting and stopping the stopwatch.
Press the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to zero.
